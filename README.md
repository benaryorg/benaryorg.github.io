# What is this?

This is just a little template (you only need the `script.js` file and some
parts of `index.html`) for a fully working blog software using only statically
served files and renders itself using JavaScript.

# Can I use it too?

Yes you can, just adjust it to your needs and use it compliant to the MIT
License.

## How?

`posts.txt` contains all the blog entries delimited using `;` you have the
file to be loaded (can be anything, even an URL to a different server, beware
XSS though) in the first column and in the second you have the displayed title.
