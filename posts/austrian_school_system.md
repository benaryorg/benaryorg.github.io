# The Austrian School System

I will here describe the Austrian school system as it currently (2016-06-05)
works and what educational paths it offers.

## Meta

This is just from what I remember, if I forgot something, please tell me, I'll
add it, and if something is unclear or you want more information about
something, please ask me.

Hell, tell me if I made a typo.

## General

The Austrian school system aims to provide a basic education for everyone.
This includes five years of mandatory school attendance and various types of
schools with different purposes.

### "Years"

As mentioned above years are being used as single units of education.
One year consists of two semesters, the first beginning right after summer, the
second about one to two months after Christmas.

### States of Austria

Austria consists of nine "Bundesländer" comparable to the U.S.'s states like
Texas, California and the like, just way smaller, due to Austria being smaller
and with a different political structure.

### Numbers

There are a lot of countries counting the grades from 1 and just incrementing
that number up to (excluding) university.

In Austria this is different.
You start in the first grade of your first school and after finishing that
school you start in the first grade of the next school.

### Holidays

In Austria some states have shifted summer-holidays by one, two or three(?)
weeks.
Lengths are the same everywhere:

	+-----------+---------+---------------------------+
	| Holiday   | Length  | Time (approximately)      |
	+===========+=========+===========================+
	| Summer    | 9 weeks | starting July             |
	+-----------+---------+---------------------------+
	| Christmas | 2 weeks | starting 24th of December |
	+-----------+---------+---------------------------+
	| Easter    | 1 week  | Easter                    |
	+-----------+---------+---------------------------+
	| Semester  | 1 week  | between semesters         |
	+-----------+---------+---------------------------+

Probably more.
I dunno.

Also, Saturdays and Sundays are off.

### Lessons

You have up to 9 lessons (50 min each) per day with one lunchbreak mandatory
after 6 consecutive lessons.

### Grades

	+-------+------------+
	| Grade | Quality    |
	+=======+============+
	| 1     | Very Good  |
	+-------+------------+
	| 2     | Good       |
	+-------+------------+
	| 3     | Okay       |
	+-------+------------+
	| 4     | Enough     |
	+-------+------------+
	| 5     | Not Enough |
	+-------+------------+

## First

### Volksschule

The first school one attends is the Volksschule or Grundschule (Elementary
School).
This school is four years in length and teaches children the basics of Maths,
Geography and all the other stuff you'll actually need in your life.

This school does not have tests, except for the fourth grade where you do have
your first exams as a preparation for the higher schools.

Students get one teacher at the start of those four years and keep that teacher
until graduation and, besides subjects like Physical Education and Religion,
all subjects will be taught by that teacher.

## Second

### Neue Mittelschule

This school was the Hauptschule earlier but there was a huge change for that
school type renaming it.

Here you have your first tests, you will learn higher maths (negative numbers,
algebra), have more subjects, each subject being taught by a different teacher.

This school is four years in length.

Some of these schools do have different branches, e.g. IT (no, don't think this
is more than using Word and the accompanying tools), or arts (more drawing
lessons).

### Gymnasium

This is practically the same as the Neue Mittelschule for the first four years,
just that it has the reputation of better education (a long time ago this was
true).

However you might have already guessed, this school is longer than four years
by combining the Second and Third stages (see Gymnasium below).
This school is intended as a eight year school finishing with the final exam
called Matura (see below).

## Third

### Polytechnische

Here you just have one year without exam I think, this is just for people
wanting to start working to get the ninth mandatory year and some job advice.

### Gymnasium

Either you stay in the Gymnasium, which is only possible after being there the
first four years, except for OGs which do only have the last four years.

This school is for general education and the Matura.

### Fachhochschule

This school is.… actually I have no idea if this belongs after the second or
the third four years.

It is four years and teaches specifically for one type of job e.g. IT-Security.

### HTL – Höhere Technische Lehranstalt

This school is five years in length finishing with Matura.

You learn something branch specific, e.g. five years of learning programming.

Finishing with Matura.

### HAK – Handelsakademie

Basically an HTL for financial stuff. Not the interesting stuff, the boring
with writing numbers down all day and at the end of the year calculating tax.

### HaSch – Handelsschule

Like HAK, just three years without Matura.

### Lehre

You can also just go to some employer and ask them to teach you everything you
need to start at their company and possibly make a career or something.

This counts as education if done in some special way.
I don't know much about this.

## Matura

Matura is a final exam, now centralised and standardised in a lot of subjects.

Having a Matura is good when looking for a job and enables attending a
university (I don't know if it is a strict requirement).

Grades are: very good, passed, not passed
