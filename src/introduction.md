# Introduction

So you've found my [blag](https://xkcd.com/148/)?
It's not like I've deliberately hidden so yeah, figures.

At some point I wanted to write a few articles about how I write code, and I actually started writing those.
You can find them in the *Legacy* section.

In case you read this in a far away future in which I actually did follow through with my plan; chances are you'll also see a few entries in a journal-like fashion.
I've been pondering about it for a while and it seems feasible to actually jot down notes while doing some work and then just sort those notes when I'm done doing whatever I was doing and using that as both a journal and a blog that I can refer to at the same time.
As said, far away future, so if you're looking for that and it's not here yet, chances are it doesn't even exist.
