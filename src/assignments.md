# Assignments

So, every once in a while a friend of mine gets into computer science (or something else entirely).
I get curious.

I know they're a beginner when coding and I'm throwing way too many fancy concepts at them, but I wanna do things properly so friggin' badly.

Sometimes I do some assignments.
Not for them.
Not for me.
Just for the sake of it.

This is a collection.
